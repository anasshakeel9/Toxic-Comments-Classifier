Toxic Comments Classifier: A machine learning project that aims to classify toxic comments on social media platforms, utilizing a Twitter dataset. This project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, leveraging libraries such as NLTK, pandas, and scikit-learn to preprocess and analyze the text data. The classifier is built using a RandomForestClassifier, trained on a document-term matrix created using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. By identifying and flagging toxic comments, this project contributes to creating a safer and more respectful online environment.
